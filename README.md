# 🐍 Capstone Project – Python Fundamentals

## 📘 Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate foundational Python programming and data analysis skills using NumPy and Pandas.
This project simulates real-world data handling scenarios — from data cleaning and transformation to business logic implementation — while showcasing proficiency in data wrangling techniques.

## 🧠 Project Description

In this project, I worked with three interrelated datasets representing employee, seniority, and project details.
The task involved creating Python DataFrames, cleaning and joining data, and applying analytical logic to simulate HR and project management insights.

Key steps included:

Creating and exporting three separate DataFrames as .csv files.

Handling missing data using a running average technique with a loop.

Splitting and restructuring columns (e.g., separating full names).

Merging multiple DataFrames into a master dataset.

Implementing conditional operations:

Assigning bonuses to completed projects.

Promoting or demoting employees based on project outcomes and age.

Generating summary reports such as total project cost per employee.

Filtering and displaying records based on specific criteria.

## ⚙️ Methodology

Data Loading and Cleaning: Used Pandas to read CSVs, handle null values, and transform data.

Data Manipulation: Used conditional logic (if, loops) and functions to modify columns.

Merging and Aggregation: Combined datasets using merge() and calculated total costs.

String and Conditional Operations: Modified names, applied designations, and filtered data.

Final Output: Produced clean, structured datasets with derived insights.

## 🧾 Key Learnings

Efficient use of Python DataFrames for real-world business scenarios.

Practical application of loops, conditionals, and merging in Pandas.

Understanding data relationships and transformations across multiple sources.

Hands-on experience in data cleaning, joining, and analysis automation.
